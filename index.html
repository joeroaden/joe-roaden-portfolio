  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My wife and I moved to Portland, Oregon from Dayton, Ohio in 2014.  We were both working for US Bank at the time and were able to transfer our jobs.  We both enjoy hiking and the outdoors so the Pacific Northwest was an awesome fit!  We bought our first home here in Portland in 2017 and have 2 cats and 2 dogs.  We enjoy traveling together, hiking, going to the coast and attending concerts together.  I am very passionate about Music and spend most of my free time writing and recording.  When I am not working on music you will find me on the disc gold course! </p>
